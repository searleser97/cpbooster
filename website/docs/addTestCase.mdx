import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

You can add a test case associated with the give source file
by passing the `--add` flag or its alias `-a` to the `test` command.
See [Test](/docs/test).

```txt
cpb t A.DistanceAndAxis.cpp -a
```

## Demo


<div className="text--center">
  <img alt="test" src={useBaseUrl('/img/demos/add-test-case.gif')} />
</div>

## How Does It Work?

This Command will create the corresponding `.inX` and `.ansX` files
with the same name as the source file.
This is because `cpbooster` uses filenames to associate test cases and
source files. See [File Structure](/docs/clone#file-structure) for better understanding.

:::note
The id `X` will be equal to the maximum test case ID that already exists plus 1.

## Creating Your First Configuration File

Execute the following command to create a configuration file:

```shell
cpbooster init
```

This command will create a file called `cpbooster-config.json` in your **$HOME** directory with default values.
If you wish to create your configuration file somewhere else you can specify the path using `--configPath` flag
each time you run a command.

:::tip
By default `cpbooster` looks for the configuration file in any of the following directories

1. `$HOME/cpbooster-config.json`
2. `$HOME/.cpbooster/cpbooster-config.json`
3. `$HOME/.config/cpbooster/cpbooster-config.json`

Take a look at [**this issue**](https://github.com/searleser97/cpbooster/issues/7)
for context.

## Fields Description

### `contestsDirectory: string`

The path to the directory where contests folders will be created when you run `cpb clone`.

The directory of a user that has cloned 3 contests would look like this:

```txt
$ cd path/to/contests/directory
$ tree -L 1
.
├── AtCoder-AtCoderBeginnerContest194
├── AtCoder-AtCoderRegularContest113
└── Codeforces-CodeforcesRound665Div.2
```

### `port: number`

Specifies the **port** where [competitive companion extension](https://github.com/jmerle/competitive-companion) will send problem's data.
**1327** is the default port for `cpbooster` in competitive companion so, if you don't change
the port, it will just work as expected. If you must change it, then be sure that you also
change it in competitive companion extension settings.

### `editor: string`

Name of the **editor** that will be opened after running `cpb clone`.
The **editor** value should match with the terminal command you use to launch it. See [Editor Requirements](#editor-requirements)

:::note
An **editor** can be a [terminal emulator](#list-of-supported-terminals) also.
:::

#### Editor Requirements

1. You must be able to open your **editor** using a terminal command.
2. If the **editor** is a **terminal emulator** it should be in the [list of supported terminals](#list-of-supported-terminals).
3. If the **editor** is NOT a **terminal emulator**. The **editor command** should support the following format to open a directory:

```shell
$ editor [directory]
```

If your editor does not support this format but has another way to open a directory, you could take a look at
"[How to add an editor](/docs/add-editor-support)"

#### Examples

- Using **regular editor** ( _VSCode_ ):

```json
{
  "editor": "code"
}
```

since `code` is the command that is used to execute _vscode_ from the terminal.

- Using **terminal emulator** ( _konsole_ ):

```json
{
  "editor": "konsole"
}
```

:::note
**Terminal Emulator** support is currently limited to this [List of supported terminals](#list-of-supported-terminals).
Visit the section "[How to add an editor](/docs/add-editor-support)" if you wish to contribute and add support
for other terminal emulators.
:::

#### List of supported terminals

- `"konsole"`
- `"xterm"`
- `"gnome-terminal"`
- `"deepin-terminal"`
- `"kitty"`
- `"alacritty"`
- `"terminal"` (MacOS)

### `closeAfterClone: boolean`

Whether to close the terminal after the execution of `cpb clone` or not.

:::caution
When using this option as `true` verify that your [**editor**](#editor-string) satisfies the [Editor Requirements](#editor-requirements), otherwise,
you might end up with your terminal closed and no editor opened.
:::

### `showStatusPageOnSubmit: boolean`

Whether to open a browser window in the submission status page or not, after running `cpb submit`

### `useUserDefaultBrowser: boolean`

Whether to open the status page using default browser or the one bundled with `cpbooster`.
See [Submit Requirements](/docs/submit#requirements)

### `preferredLang: string`

The extension name in lowercase of your preferred language. ( i.e. `"cpp"`, `"py"`, `"java"`, ... ),
`cpb clone` uses this value to create corresponding source files with the template of your
preferred language.

:::important
This value must match exactly (case-sensitive) with the extension used in the source files.
:::

### `hideTestCaseInput: boolean`

Whether or not to show the test case input when testing

### `cloneInCurrentDir: boolean`

When true it clones contests or single problems in current directory instead
of the global [contest directory](#contestsdirectory-string).

### `executableFileExtension: string`

The preferred file extension for the compiled binary.

### `languages: Record<LangExtension, LangConfig>`

In `languages` you can configure the settings of each programming language.

:::note
`cpbooster` officially supports the following languages:

- `c`
- `c++`
- `rust`
- `go`
- `python`
- `javascript`
- `ruby`
- `java`
- `kotlin`
- `scala`

officially supporting these languages means that they were tested exhaustively, however,
**other languages might be supported as well** due to the generality of the algorithm used to parse the commands
to compile or run. In case `cpbooster` can't work correctly with the language you wish to use,
visit the section "[How to add a language](/docs/add-language-support)" which will guide you on how to contribute
to the project.
:::

:::important
The keys (`<lang>`) must match exactly (case-sensitive) with the extension used in the source files.
i.e. if you use `cpp` extension for your `c++` programs then you must use `cpp` as key
of the json object, `CPP` won't work, neither `Cpp` nor `cPP`, ... and the same applies
for the languages
:::

### `languages.<lang>.template: string`

Path to your competitive programming template for the corresponding `<lang>`.

Here are some examples of competitive programming templates (if you wish, you can download them and use them):

- [CompetitiveProgrammingTemplate.cpp](https://gitlab.com/searleser97/competitive-programming-reference/-/blob/master/Reference/Coding%20Resources/C++/Competitive%20Programming%20Template.cpp)
  - This template allows you to print anything like in python with a `debug` function that just works when `debugCommand` is used. See [Debug](/docs/debug) section.
- [CompetitiveProgrammingTemplate.py](https://gitlab.com/searleser97/competitive-programming-reference/-/blob/master/Reference/Coding%20Resources/Python/Competitive%20Programming%20Template.py)
  - This template includes Fast IO operations for python

### `languages.<lang>.command: string`

The command that will be used to compile
([`compiled` or `mixed` languages](#languageslangtype-compiled--interpreted--mixed))
or run ([`interpreted` languages](#languageslangtype-compiled--interpreted--mixed)) your program for testing purposes.

For example: If you use codeforces it is convenient that you use the same command they use for each language

```json
{
  "languages": {
    "cpp": {
      "command": "g++ -std=gnu++17 -O2"
    },
    "py": {
      "command": "python3"
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip
If you specify the name of the executable file in this command, it will
be used instead of the default name (same as source file). See [**Test**](/docs/test) section.

**Example:** In `C++` you can use the `-o` flag to specify the name of the executable file that will be created after compilation.

```json
{
  "languages": {
    "cpp": {
      "command": "g++ -std=gnu++17 -o executableName.exe"
    }
  }
}
```

:::

### `languages.<lang>.debugCommand: string`

The command that will be used to compile
([`compiled` or `mixed` languages](#languageslangtype-compiled--interpreted--mixed)) or run
([`interpreted` languages](#languageslangtype-compiled--interpreted--mixed)) your program for debugging purposes.
Usually `debugCommand` has more flags than `command`.

Some debug command examples for `cpp` and `py`:

```json
{
  "languages": {
    "cpp": {
      "command": "g++ -std=gnu++17 -O2",
      "debugCommand": "g++ -std=gnu++17 -O3 -DDEBUG -Wshadow -Wall"
    },
    "py": {
      "command": "python3",
      "debugCommand": "python3 -O"
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip
You can specify the name of the executable file in the same way you would do it
in <a href={"#languageslangcommand-string"} style={{color: 'white'}}>`languages.<lang>.command`</a>.

Visit the [**Debug**](/docs/debug) section to see usage examples of this feature.
:::

### `languages.<lang>.runCommand: string`

The command that will be used to run [`mixed`](#languageslangtype-compiled--interpreted--mixed)
type languages like (java, kotlin, scala, ...).

:::note
This type of languages are compiled with some command (i.e. javac, kotlinc, scalac, ...) but
they get run with a different one (java, kotlin, scala, ...)
:::

### `languages.<lang>.aliases: Object<OnlineJudgeName, string>`

Language "aliases" for each OnlineJudge. See [How To Configure Language Aliases](/docs/submit#how-to-configure-language-aliases).

For example: the alias for `C++` in Codeforces and AtCoder is `"54"` and `"4006"` respectively

```json
{
  "languages": {
    "cpp": {
      "aliases": {
        "codeforces": "54",
        "atcoder": "4006"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### `languages.<lang>.type: "compiled" | "interpreted" | "mixed"`

Specifies whether the language is `"compiled"` (`C++`, `go`, `rust`, `C#`),
`"interpreted"` (`python`, `javascript`, `ruby`, ...) or `"mixed"` (`java`, `kotlin`, `scala`, ...).
`cpbooster` is aware that some languages can be `interpreted` as well as `compiled`,
like `python` which can be compiled with [nuitka](https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka) or `javascript` which
can be compiled with [nectarjs](https://github.com/NectarJS/nectarjs).
With this option you have the chance to tell `cpbooster` how to work with
the language you provide. For a definition of `mixed` languages, See [Mixed Languages](add-language-support#mixed)

:::note
In case this option is not provided, then `cpbooster` will try to infer the type
depending on the language. But consider that `cpbooster` is not aware of all the languages
it actually support, specifying this option reduces the risk of unexpected errors.
See [Languages Support](#languages-recordlangextension-langconfig)
:::

### `languages.<lang>.commentString: string`

Tells `cpbooster` which comment string to use depending on the language.
`cpbooster` uses a generic algorithm to support a great variety of languages,
some of them are know by `cpbooster` but some others are unknown for it,
therefore `cpbooster` might not know how to write comments in that language.

:::note
Comments are used to write information in the source code file such as:

- time-limit
- problem-url

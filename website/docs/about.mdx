title: What is cpbooster?
---

`cpbooster` is a cross-platform **CLI** tool designed to **boost** competitive programmer's speed during contests by automating various routine tasks
like compiling and testing, debugging, cloning testcases, loading template, etc. The console command suits any coding environment
(i.e. _**VSCode, Jetbrains IDEs, Vim, NeoVim, Emacs, Geany, Sublime Text, ...**_) and it’s very easy to use. _Vim / NeoVim_ users can
install [cpbooster.vim plugin](https://github.com/searleser97/cpbooster.vim) to **boost** their speed even more.

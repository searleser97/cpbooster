`cpbooster` provides the following command for you to easily test your program against
**all** available test cases.

```txt
cpb test <filePath>
```

or the alias for `test` which is just `t`.

```txt
cpb t <filePath>
```

This command will **automatically compile** your program everytime you run it.
See [Test Without Recompiling](#test-without-recompiling) for details on how to avoid recompiling your program each time.

### Executable File Details

The executable file will be located in your current directory and its name will
match with the name of the source file except for the extension, which will be `.exe`. 
For example, if your source file name is `ProblemA.cpp` then the executable file
name will be `ProblemA.exe`.This is because `cpbooster` uses filenames to associate
everything (See [**File Structure**](/docs/clone#file-structure) for better understanding).
If you wish to save the executable file with a different name,
you can specify it in your <a href={"/docs/configuration#languageslangcommand-string"} style={{color: 'white'}}>`languages.<lang>.command`</a>.


## Test With A Single Test Case

You can specify the test case, using the `--testId` flag or its alias `-t`.

```txt
cpb t <filePath> -t <number>
```

:::important
`<number>` should match with the numeric suffix of the corresponding `.in` and `.ans` files
See [**File Structure**](/docs/clone#file-structure) for better understanding.
:::

## Test Without Recompiling

You can tell `cpbooster` to run the tests using the last compiled version of your program
by passing the flag `--noCompile` or its alias  `--nc`.

```txt
cpb t <filePath> --nc
```

:::caution
By using this flag, `cpbooster` will assume that there is a corresponding executable file
for your program. Remember that the name of the executable file must be the same as the
source file, except for the extension which must be `.exe`. Unless you specified otherwise
in <a href={"/docs/configuration#languageslangcommand-string"} style={{color: 'white'}}>`languages.<lang>.command`</a>.

## How does it work?

This sections explains How each possible output of the `test` command work.

### Compilation Error

If your code needs compilation (`cpp`, `java`, ...), this will be the first thing that `cpbooster` will
try to do, unless the `--noCompile` flag was used.

#### Demo

<div className="text--center">
  <img alt="test" src={useBaseUrl('/img/demos/test_ce.gif')} />
</div>

### Runtime Error

`cpbooster` detects that there was a runtime error if your program exited with a [status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status) different from **0**
or if there were no corresponding `.in` and `.ans` files (See [File Structure](/docs/clone#file-structure) for better understanding).

#### Demo

<div className="text--center">
  <img alt="test" src={useBaseUrl('/img/demos/test_rte.gif')} />
</div>

### Time Limit Exceeded

To detect that the execution of a certain program has exceeded the time limit, `cpbooster` requires to know
which is this time limit beforehand, the default value is **3000** milliseconds which equivalent to **3** seconds.
To use a different value, the string `time-limit:` followed by the time limit in numeric format as **milliseconds**
should be written somewhere in the source file as a commented line.

#### Examples:

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
<div>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>
C++
</th>
<th>
Python
</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>

```cpp
// time-limit: 2000
int main() {
 int a, b;
 cin >> a >> b;
 cout << a + b << endl;
}
```

</td>
<td>

```py
# time-limit: 2000

a, b = map(int, input().split())
print(a + b)
```
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</div>

:::note
This line will be automatically added at the top of your source file with the default value
when running `cpb clone` or `cpb create`.
:::

#### Demo

<div className="text--center">
  <img alt="test" src={useBaseUrl('/img/demos/test_tle.gif')} />
</div>


### Wrong Answer

Each time you run a test, `cpbooster` will create one or more `.outX` files (in the same directory as the
source file) which will correspond to your program's output when using the correponding `.inX` file as
input.
Each `.outX` file will be compared against the corresponding `.ansX` file and if
there are differences, they will be printed beautifully.


:::important IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS

1. Each `.in`, `.ans` and `.out` file will and must have the same name as the source file associated with them.
This is because `cpbooster` uses file names to make associations. See [**File Structure**](/docs/clone#file-structure).

1. `X` should be an integer number and every `.in`, `.ans` and `.out` file associated with a certain test case,
must have the same numeric suffix `X`.
:::

#### Demo

<div className="text--center">
  <img alt="test" src={useBaseUrl('/img/demos/test_wa.gif')} />
</div>


### Accepted Solution

If there were no errors or differences between the `.out` and `.ans` files, `cpbooster` will tell you that you have an
**Accepted Solution**.

:::tip
`cpbooster` will also tell you if your solution has extra leading or trailing blank spaces.
<div className="text--center">
  <img alt="test" src={useBaseUrl('/img/demos/test_ac_2.gif')} />
</div>
